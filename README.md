# FS22_HarvesterFillMonitor
Script to monitor the fill level of combines/harvesters when being run by CoursePlay or Giants helper.

This was the original script from ViperGTS96, which I've amended/added to

https://fs22.com/farming-simulator-22-mods/other/harvester-fill-monitor-v1-0/



This script shows the fill % and fuel % level of any harvesters being managed by a helper.

When fuel or fill capacity has < 20% availablilty text turns amber.
When fuel or fill capacity has < 10% availablilty text turns red.
